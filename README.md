# About
This project is made up of **[Stage 1](#stage-1)** and **[Stage 2](#stage-2)**.

## Stage 1
Objective: design and create the structure of an Inventory App that will allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about the product and allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

**Note: This stage of the project will not have any UI components**

* Creating a SQLite table in your app
* Populating that table with new entries
* Modifying the entries
* Displaying the contents of the table to users.

## Stage 2
