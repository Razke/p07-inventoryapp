# About
This project is made up of **[Stage 1](#stage-1)** and **[Stage 2](#stage-2)**.

## Stage 1
Objective: design and create the structure of an Inventory App that will allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about the product and allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

**Note: This stage of the project will not have any UI components**

This project is about combining various ideas and skills practiced throughout the course. They include:

* Creating a SQLite table in your app
* Populating that table with new entries
* Modifying the entries
* Displaying the contents of the table to users.

## Stage 2
Objective: in Stage 1, you designed and implemented the backend database that stores information about the products and suppliers. In this stage, you'll build out the app UI for users to add and remove inventory.
